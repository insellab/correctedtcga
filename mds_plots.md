### MDS (Multidimensional Scaling) plots generated via EdgeR (Robinson et al, 2010) showing how TCGA and GTEX samples cluster

Files are plotted in Excel with X and Y coordinates for each point/sample on the MDS plots. These plots provide information about how closely or diffusely groups of samples cluster together, viz. gene expression. A useful primer on the principle of multidimensional scaling can be found [here](http://www.analytictech.com/borgatti/mds.htm).

Information about samples (tumor subtype, whether primary tumor or matched normal etc.) are also provided as needed.

The tumor types below include tumor subtypes as described in [Table 1](https://insellab.github.io/Picture1.jpg), e.g. the file with Breast Cancer IDC includes Her2+, Hormone Receptor+, Triple + and Triple - subtypes of BRCA IDC.
